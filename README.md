# SoCog_validation
This code is associated to a study validating a neuropsychological test (social cognition) in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI, i.e. a stroke or a traumatic brain injury).
More information: marie.pittet93@gmail.com

The code features: 
- demographics
- known-group validity (ANOVAs and fun mean difference comparison, cute rain-cloud plots)
- diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity/specificity, AUC)
- convergent validity (correlational methods)
- test-retest reliability (correlational methods)
- veridicality analysis (linear modelling, prediction of a questionnaire of daily functioning scores, fun visualization)
- Covariate analysis (verifying the influence of other neuropsychological scores on social cognition, ANCOVA)
- Item-Response Theory (dimensionality analyses, Rasch modelling, some playing aroung with polytomous models)


Data is not available due its sensitive nature (medical data). It may be made available upon publication.
